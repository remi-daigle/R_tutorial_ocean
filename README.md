tidal_mecahnics_teaching_aid
============================

A simple tidal mechanics model written in R, can be used as an R tutorial and an exercise to learn about tides. These instructions assume you have already installed R (http://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/). Also, if you are not already using the GitHub native app, you should really consider using Git or GitHub in the future! Version control will improve your life.

Instructions:
============
1. If you have the GitHub native app installed (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows) you can click "Clone in Desktop", otherwise click "Download ZIP" and extract the folder 

2. Open Rstudio, in the files tab (bottom right) find the folder you just downloaded that includes the project tidal_mechanics_teaching_aid.Rproj

3. Load tidal_mechanics_teaching_aid.R and follow the instructions in that script. Enjoy!
