R_ocean_teaching_aid
============================

A simple tidal mechanics model written in R, can be used as an R tutorial and an exercise to learn about tides. These instructions assume you have already installed R (http://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/). Also, if you are not already using the GitHub native app, you should really consider using Git or GitHub in the future! Version control will improve your life.

Instructions:
============
1. If you have the GitHub native app installed (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows) you can click "Clone in Desktop", otherwise click "Download ZIP" and extract the folder 

2. Open Rstudio, in the files tab (bottom right) find the folder you just downloaded that includes the project R_tutorial_ocean.Rproj

3. Open the "Lesson 1 tidal mechanics" folder, load tidal_mechanics.R and follow the instructions in that script. Enjoy!

4. Keep going through the lessons until you are an R pro!

Lessons:
=======

Lesson 1: tidal mechanics
- Create a model of M2 and S2 tides
- Learn to comment, create variables, and basic dataframe operations ($ and [])
- Learn to use for loops

Lesson 2: species abundance and mapping
- Examine basic patterns in intertidal species abundance
- Learn to load data from spreadsheets and advanced dataframe manipulations (merge and ddply)
